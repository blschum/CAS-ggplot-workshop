# {ggplot2} Workshop
Last update: 2022
Britta Schumacher

## Getting started
If you are participating in the workshop, you may either (a) work on the [ggplot-workshop-TEMPLATE.Rmd], which leaves space for participants to type code with instruction, or (b) follow along along in the [ggplot-workshop-KEY.Rmd], which has all of the information and code we will be working with. Download the [ggplot-workshop-KEY.html] for a knitted (and much easier to read) version of the KEY.

## Outline
1. Reminder: How do we use the tidyverse?
2. Useful functions to know for data wrangling, subsetting, manipulating, and summarising data
3. What is ggplot?
4. Plotting data + bonus intro to sf()

## Description
`ggplot2` is a package that builds graphs based on user parameters. Every graph is built from the same few components: 1) a clean and tidy dataset; 2) a set of `geoms` that map out data points; and 3) a 'coordinate system' (i.e., how will the data be mapped onto a graphical surface). To display data values, variables are mapped to aesthetic parameters like size, color, and x and y locations, and a type of visualization is defined (e.g., bar graph, box pot, line graph, density plots, etc.). During this workshop, participants live code along with the instructor and learn how to create graphs using best practices for data visualization.

## Data source
